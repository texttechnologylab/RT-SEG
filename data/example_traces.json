  "trc1": "Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. The question is asking for the sum of all integer bases b > 9 where 17_b is a divisor of 97_b. Hmm, first I need to understand what these numbers mean in different bases.\n\nSo, in base b, the number 17_b would be equal to 1*b^1 + 7*b^0, which simplifies to b + 7. Similarly, 97_b is 9*b^1 + 7*b^0, so that's 9b + 7. The problem states that 17_b divides 97_b, meaning that (9b + 7) divided by (b + 7) should be an integer. So, I need to find all bases b > 9 where (9b + 7)/(b + 7) is an integer.\n\nLet me write that division as a fraction: (9b + 7)/(b + 7). Maybe I can simplify this expression. Let's try polynomial division or see if I can rewrite it. Let me see:\n\nIf I divide 9b + 7 by b + 7, maybe I can do some algebra. Let's see:\n\nLet me consider 9b + 7 divided by b + 7. Let's write it as 9*(b + 7) - 63 + 7 divided by (b + 7). Wait, that might not be helpful. Alternatively, maybe express the numerator in terms of the denominator.\n\nLet me think. Let me write 9b + 7 as 9*(b + 7) - 63 + 7. Wait, 9*(b + 7) is 9b + 63. So 9b +7 = 9*(b +7) - 56. Therefore, (9b +7)/(b +7) = 9 - 56/(b +7). So the expression simplifies to 9 - 56/(b +7). For this to be an integer, 56/(b +7) must be an integer. Therefore, (b +7) must be a divisor of 56.\n\nSo, since b > 9, then b +7 must be a positive divisor of 56, and also since b +7 must be greater than 9 +7 = 16? Wait, no. Wait, b is greater than 9, so b +7 is greater than 16. Therefore, we need to find all positive divisors of 56 that are greater than 16, and then subtract 7 from them to get b.\n\nWait, but let me check. Let me list all divisors of 56. The divisors of 56 are 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, 56. But since b +7 must be greater than 16 (since b >9), then the possible divisors are 28, 56. Because 14 is 14, which would make b +7=14 → b=7, but b must be greater than 9. So 14 is too small. Similarly, 8 and 7 are too small. So the only divisors of 56 greater than 16 are 28 and 56. Therefore, b +7 =28 or 56. Therefore, b=21 or b=56-7=49. Wait, 56-7 is 49. So the possible bases are 21 and 49. Therefore, the sum is 21 +49=70.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Let me verify each case.\n\nFirst, for b=21: 17_b is 1*21 +7=28. 97_b is 9*21 +7=198. 198 divided by 28 is 7. So 198/28=7. So yes, that works.\n\nFor b=49: 17_b is 1*49 +7=56. 97_b is 9*49 +7=441 +7=448. 448 divided by 56 is 8. So that's also an integer. So both cases work.\n\nAre there any other divisors? Let me check again. The divisors of 56 are 1,2,4,7,8,14,28,56. So the ones greater than 16 are 28 and 56. So yes, only those two. Therefore, the answer is 21 +49=70. So the sum is 70.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure there are no other divisors. For example, if b +7 is a divisor of 56, but maybe negative divisors? But since b>9, b+7>16, so divisors have to be positive. So no negative divisors. So yes, only 28 and 56. So the answer is 21 +49=70.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 70. Let me check if that's correct. Yes, seems right.",
  "trc2": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is about a Cold War defecting Soviet software engineer who gets a cryptic message from a CIA operative. The operative says \\\"Meet them at Кома\\\" which the programmer can't find on a map. Then he jokes about entering a coma, but the operative says the location is on the map but not labeled. So the programmer needs to find it.\n\nFirst, I need to think about what \\\"Кома\\\" could mean. The word \\\"Кома\\\" in Russian is \\\"coma,\\\" but the operative says it's not labeled on the map. However, the location is present. Maybe it's a play on words. Let me think about possible places in Russia that might have names related to \\\"coma\\\" but are not directly labeled. Alternatively, maybe it's a misspelling or a different word.\n\nWait, \\\"Кома\\\" could be an abbreviation or a misspelled word. Maybe it's a reference to a place that's a part of a larger region. For example, sometimes regions or districts have names that are parts of words. Let me consider the answer choices.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Kaliningrad Oblast – This is a region in Russia near Poland. Its capital is Kaliningrad. Not sure how it connects to \\\"кома.\\\"\n\nB. Perm Krai – A region in the Urals. Maybe not directly related.\n\nC. Taymyrsky Dolgano-Nenetsky District – This is in the far north, part of the Krasnoyarsk Krai. The name includes \\\"Taymyrsky,\\\" which might be related to the Taymyr Peninsula. Not sure.\n\nD. Chukotka Autonomous Okrug – This is a remote region in the far east, known for its isolation. The name is Chukotka, which sounds like \\\"Chukotka.\\\" Not sure about the connection.\n\nE. Republic of Adygea – Located in the Caucasus. The name is Adygea, which might not relate.\n\nWait, the operative says \\\"Кома\\\" is on the map but not labeled. Maybe it's a misspelling of a place's name. Let me think of the word \\\"Кома\\\" as a part of a larger name. For example, if the operative said \\\"Koma,\\\" maybe it's a part of a place's name. Let me think of the answer choices again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \\\"Кома\\\" is a Russian word that's a part of a place's name. For example, \\\"Кома\\\" could be part of a district or region. Let me think about the answer choices again. \n\nWait, the key is that the location is present on the map but not labeled. So maybe \\\"Кома\\\" is a part of a larger name. For example, if the operative said \\\"Koma,\\\" but the actual place is named something else. Let me think about the possible answer choices. \n\nAnother angle: the programmer is a software engineer. Maybe the answer involves a place that's a \\\"coma\\\" in a different way. For example, \\\"coma\\\" in Russian is \\\"кома,\\\" which is a medical term. But the operative says the location is present on the map. Maybe the operative is referring to a place that's a part of a larger name. For example, if the actual location is a district or region that includes \\\"Koma\\\" in its name but is not directly labeled. \n\nLooking at the answer choices again:\n\nOption C is \\\"Taymyrsky Dolgano-Nenetsky District.\\\" The name includes \\\"Taymyrsky,\\\" which is related to the Taymyr Peninsula. But how does that connect to \\\"кома\\\"?\n\nWait, maybe the operative's message is a play on the word \\\"кома.\\\" Let me think: \\\"кома\\\" is \\\"coma,\\\" but maybe it's a misspelling or a homophone for a place. For example, in Russian, \\\"Кома\\\" could be a misspelling of \\\"Коми\\\" (Komi Republic), but that's not one of the options. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the location is \\\"Komi Republic,\\\" but that's not listed. Wait, the answer choices don't include Komi. Let me check the options again. The answer choices are A to E as listed. \n\nWait, perhaps the operative is referring to a place that's a part of a larger region. For example, \\\"Koma\\\" might be a part of a district's name. Let me think about the options again. \n\nLooking at option D: Chukotka Autonomous Okrug. The name is Chukotka, which is a remote region. Not sure. \n\nOption E: Republic of Adygea. Not related. \n\nWait, maybe \\\"Кома\\\" is a misspelling of \\\"Коми\\\" (Komi), which is a republic in Russia. But that's not an option. Alternatively, maybe the location is a district that's part of a larger region. \n\nAlternatively, think about the word \\\"Кома\\\" as a part of a place's name. For example, \\\"Кома\\\" could be part of \\\"Коми\\\" (Komi), but again not in the options. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is related to a place that's known for being a \\\"coma\\\" in some way. Wait, the operative says that the location is present on the map but not labeled. Maybe it's a place that's not labeled because it's a small village, but the programmer knows the location. \n\nAlternatively, think of the word \\\"Кома\\\" as a misspelling of \\\"Кома\\\" (Koma), which might be a district. Let me think of the answer choices again. \n\nOption C is \\\"Taymyrsky Dolgano-Nenetsky District.\\\" The district is part of the Krasnoyarsk Krai. The name includes \\\"Taymyrsky,\\\" which is related to the Taymyr Peninsula. But how does that connect to \\\"кома\\\"?\n\nWait, maybe \\\"Кома\\\" is a misspelling of \\\"Коми\\\" (Komi), but that's not an option. Alternatively, maybe the answer is option C. \n\nAlternatively, think about the word \\\"Кома\\\" as a part of the name of a district. For example, in Russian, some districts have names that include parts of words. \n\nAlternatively, think about the fact that the operative said the location is present on the map but not labeled. Maybe it's a place that's a district or region that's not directly named but is part of a larger region. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is option C. Let me think: \\\"Taymyrsky Dolgano-Nenetsky District\\\" is a district in the Krasnoyarsk Krai. The name includes \\\"Dolgano-Nenetsky,\\\" which refers to the Dolgan and Nenets peoples. But how does that relate to \\\"кома\\\"?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \\\"кома\\\" is a misspelling of \\\"кома\\\" (Koma), which could be a district. Wait, maybe the operative was referring to a place that's known as \\\"Koma\\\" in a different language. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is option A. Kaliningrad Oblast. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, think about the fact that \\\"Кома\\\" is a play on words. For example, \\\"кома\\\" in Russian could be a misspelling of \\\"Коми\\\" (Komi), but not in the options. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is option C. Because \\\"Taymyrsky Dolgano-Nenetsky District\\\" is in the far north, and the operative's message might have been a code. But I'm not getting it. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is option D. Chukotka Autonomous Okrug. But again, not sure. \n\nWait, maybe the operative's message is a play on the word \\\"кома\\\" (coma) as a misspelling of \\\"кома\\\" (Koma), which is a district. Let me check if any of the options have a district named Koma. \n\nLooking at the answer choices again:\n\nA. Kaliningrad Oblast – capital is Kaliningrad.\n\nB. Perm Krai – a region in the Urals.\n\nC. Taymyrsky Dolgano-N, a district in Krasnoyarsk Krai.\n\nD. Chukotka – a region in the far east.\n\nE. Adygea – a republic in the Caucasus.\n\nNone of these directly mention Koma. But perhaps \\\"Кома\\\" is a misspelling of \\\"Коми\\\" (Komi), which is a republic in Russia. But that's not listed. Alternatively, maybe the operative said \\\"Кома\\\" as a code for a place that's a district. \n\nAnother angle: the programmer is a software engineer, so maybe the answer is related to a place that's a part of a larger region. For example, the operative might have given a code name for a location. \n\nAlternatively, think about the word \\\"кома\\\" (coma) as a part of a larger name. For example, if the location is \\\"Koma\\\" in another language. \n\nAlternatively, think of the word \\\"кома\\\" as a part of a district's name. For example, \\\"Кома\\\" could be part of \\\"Кома\\\" (Koma) in some region. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is option C. Because \\\"Taymyrsky Dolgano-Nenetsky District\\\" is part of the Krasnoyarsk Krai. But how does that connect to \\\"кома\\\"? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the operative was using a code word. For example, \\\"кома\\\" could be a part of a place's name. For example, if the actual location is \\\"Koma\\\" which is a district. \n\nWait, perhaps the answer is option C. Let me think again. The operative said \\\"meet them at Кома\\\" which is not labeled on the map. But the programmer knows that \\\"кома\\\" is a part of the name of the district. For example, if the district is called \\\"Taymyrsky Dolgano-Nenetsky,\\\" but the operative said \\\"Koma,\\\" which is part of the name. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the operative was referring to a place that's a district with a name that includes \\\"Koma\\\" as a part. \n\nWait, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about other possibilities. \n\nAnother thought: \\\"Кома\\\" could be a misspelling of \\\"Коми\\\" (Komi), which is a republic in Russia. But that's not listed. However, the answer options include option C which is a district in Krasnoyarsk Krai. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is option A. Kaliningrad Oblast. Because the name \\\"Kaliningrad\\\" is similar to \\\"Koma\\\" if you mispronounce it. But that's a stretch. \n\nAlternatively, think about the fact that the operative said the location is present on the map but not labeled. So maybe it's a place that's a district, and the name is \\\"Koma\\\" but spelled differently. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is option C. Because \\\"Taymyrsky Dolgano-Nenetsky District\\\" is in the Krasnoyarsk Krai, and the operative's message \\\"Koma\\\" could be a code for that district. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is option D. Chukotka Autonomous Okrug. But I'm not sure. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is option C. Let me think again. The operative said \\\"meet them at Кома,\\\" which is not labeled. The programmer, being a software engineer, might think of \\\"Кома\\\" as a part of the name of a district. For example, if the district is called \\\"Taymyrsky Dolgano-Nenetsky,\\\" but the operative said \\\"Koma,\\\" which is part of the name. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \\\"кома\\\" is a misspelling of \\\"кома\\\" (Koma), which is a district. But I can't find any such district. \n\nAlternatively, think of the word \\\"кома\\\" as a part of the name of a district. For example, \\\"Koma\\\" could be part of \\\"Koma\\\" in some region. \n\nAlternatively, the answer is option C. I'm not sure, but I'll go with that. \n\nWait, another angle: the operative said the location is present on the map but not labeled. So maybe it's a place that's not labeled because it's a small village, but the programmer knows the location. However, the answer choices are all regions or districts. \n\nAlternatively, the answer is option C. I'm not sure, but given the options, I'll have to choose. \n\nAfter considering all possibilities, I think the correct answer is option C. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is option A. \n\nWait, another thought: \\\"Кома\\\" could be a misspelling of \\\"Коми\\\" (Komi), which is a republic. But since that's not an option, maybe the answer is option C. \n\nAlternatively, the operative's message is a play on words. For example, \\\"кома\\\" (coma) could be a misspelling of \\\"кома\\\" (Koma), which is a district. But I can't find any such district. \n\nAlternatively, the answer is option C. So I'll go with C."
